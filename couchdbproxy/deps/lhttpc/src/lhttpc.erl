%% Instead of building and parsing URLs the target server is specified with
%% a host, port, weither SSL should be used or not and a path on the server.
%% For instance, if you want to request http://example.com/foobar you would
%% use the following:<br/>
%% `Host' = `"example.com"'<br/>
%% `Port' = `80'<br/>
%% `Ssl' = `false'<br/>
%% `Path' = `"/foobar"'<br/>
%% `Path' must begin with a forward slash `/'.
%% 
%% `Method' is either a string, stating the HTTP method exactly as in the
%% protocol, i.e: `"POST"' or `"GET"'. It could also be an atom, which is
%% then made in to uppercase, if it isn't already.
%% `Hdrs' is a list of headers to send. Mandatory headers such as
%% `Host' or `Content-Length' (for some requests) are added.
%% `Body' is the entity to send in the request. Please don't include entity
%% bodies where there shouldn't be any (such as for `GET').
%% `Timeout' is the timeout for the request in milliseconds.
%% `Options' is a list of options.
%%
%% Options:
%%
%% `{connect_timeout, Milliseconds}' specifies how many milliseconds the
%% client can spend trying to establish a connection to the server. This
%% doesn't affect the overall request timeout. However, if it's longer than
%% the overall timeout it will be ignored. Also note that the TCP layer my
%% choose to give up earlier than the connect timeout, in which case the
%% client will also give up. The default value is infinity, which means that
%% it will either give up when the TCP stack gives up, or when the overall
%% request timeout is reached. 
%%
%% `{send_retry, N}' specifies how many times the client should retry
%% sending a request if the connection is closed after the data has been
%% sent. The default value is 1.
