Dependencies:
 * Erlang/OTP R12-B or newer (compiler to build, kernel and stdlib to run)
 * GNU Make (might actually build with some other make as well)
 * Eunit (for testing)

To bulid the application simply run 'make'. This should build .beam, .app
files and documentation.

Configuration: (environment variables)
 * connection_timeout: The time (in milliseconds) the client will try to
                       kepp a HTTP/1.1 connection open. Changing this value
                       in runtime has no effect, this can however be done
                       through lhttpc_manager:update_connection_timeout/1.

Development:
There are some interesting make targets:
 * test - Will compile and run all tests (using eunit)
 * dialyzer - Will run dialyzer on the application
